# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Project

A deep learning project utilizing **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate high-quality synthetic data.

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** through a **Jupyter Notebook**, providing theoretical explanations and visualizations.

## 📌 Features

- Step-by-step explanation of GAN architecture
- Interactive visualizations and graphs
- Dataset loading and preprocessing steps
- Insights into generator and discriminator training
- Analysis of GAN performance and improvements

## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV

### Setup
